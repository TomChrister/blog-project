# TechPulse - Blog project

Semester project for front end development Q4, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Brief

You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging
application.
The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog
posts.
The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts.
During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner.

## Features

• An interactive banner carousel on the blog feed page, so can you can view a
rotation of the 3 latest posts.

• A button for each carousel item, taking you to the blog post page to
read more.

• You can click on the previous or next button in the carousel to animate and reveal
another post, to ensure you can see different posts easily.

• A static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the
blog feed page, so you can easily select which post to read.

• Each thumbnail in the blog post feed is clickable, taking you to the blog post
page to read more.

• On the article page, a responsive layout showing the post title, author, publication
date, image banner, and post content from the API.

• Each blog page has a shareable URL including a query string or
hash parameter that contains the post ID, so you can share the post with others easily.

• The blog post new page is only available for the user when logged
in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made to the posts.

• A validated empty form that allows you to add the title, body
content, and image, and POST those to the API to create a new post

• The blog post edit page is only available for you when logged
in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made to my posts.

• A delete button that sends a DELETE request to the API for this
post ID on the edit page, so you can easily remove my post if needed.

• A validated edit form that allows you to update the title, body
content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID, ensuring you can
keep my the posts up to date easily.
