# TechPulse - Blog project 💻 

A blog website for the latest in technology.

## Project overview 📈

Brief:

"You have been hired to build a front-end user interface for an existing API blogging
application.
The client has asked for a responsive application that allows users to view dynamic blog
posts.
The client requires admin pages to register, login and manage their blog posts.
During testing, you will use your own account that you create to act as the owner."

## Features 🌟

• An interactive carousel on the blog feed page, showing the 3 latets articles

• A static list of the 12 latest posts in a responsive thumbnail grid on the
blog feed page

• Each thumbnail in the blog post feed is clickable, taking you to the blog post
page to read more.

• On the article page, a responsive layout showing the post title, author, publication
date, image banner, and post content from the API.

• Each blog page has a shareable URL including a query string that contains the post ID, so you can share the post with others easily.

• Creating new posts is only available for the user when logged in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made to the posts.

• Editing posts is only available for you when logged
in, to ensure no unauthorized edits can be made.

• A validated empty form that allows you to add the title, body
content, and image, and POST those to the API to create a new post

• A delete button that sends a DELETE request to the API for this
post ID on the edit page

• A validated edit form that allows you to update the title, body
content, or image by sending a POST request to the API for this post ID.
